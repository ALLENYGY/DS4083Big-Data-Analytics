 "The Da Vinci Code" is written by Dan Brown . The book is published by Doubleday, Inc., Inc. and is available now on Amazon.com/Da Vinci . The Priory of Sion — a European secret society founded in 1099 — is a real organization .
 The Vatican prelature known as Opus Dei is a deeply devout Catholic sect that has been the topic of recent controversy . The Priory of Sion has just completed construction of a $47 million World Headquarters in New York City . All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate .
 Jacques Sauniere's identity was revealed by his attacker, who smiled smugly . "When you are gone, I will be the only one who knows the truth," he said . The click of an empty chamber echoed through the corridor .
 Robert Langdon wakes up in a plush Renaissance bedroom with Louis XVI furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed . Langdon had been asleep only an hour, but he felt like the dead . "I'm sorry," Langdon said, "but I'm very tired and — " Langdon's visibility had increased a hundredfold since his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican last year .
 Langdon cringed as the hostess read choice excerpts from an article from Boston Magazine . Langdon felt himself sinking lower in his chair . "Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction," Langdon said . "If I find which one of you provided that article, I'll have the consulate agicallydeport you," he said .
 The DCPJ was the rough equivalent of the U.S. FBI . Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet . "My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter," the agent said . A little over a year ago, Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help .
 According to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone — a clef de voiite... or keystone — an engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of their greatest secret . "When we possess the keystone," the Teacher said, "we will be only one step away"
 All true followers of The Way wore a leather strap studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual reminder of Christ's suffering . The pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of the flesh . Langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator's death .
 Langdon viewed the world as a web of profoundly intertwined histories and events . The connections may be invisible, he often preached to his symbology classes at Harvard, but they are always there . Langdon had forgotten that the request of all European hotels to see a passport at check-in was more  than a quaint formality .
 Jardins des Tuileries was once an enormous, polluted excavation pit from which Parisian contractors mined clay to manufacture the city's famous red roofing tiles . Langdon had always considered the Tuilery to be sacred ground . These were the gardens in which Monet had experimented with form and color, and literally inspired the birth of the Impressionist movement .
 The new entrance to the Paris Louvre had become almost as famous as the museum itself . The controversial, neomodern glass pyramid evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt it destroyed the dignity of the Renaissance courtyard . Progressive admirers hailed Pei's seventy-one-foot-  tall transparent pyramid as a dazzling synergy of ancient structure and modern method .
 The message was clear: Nobody goes in or out tonight without the blessing of Captain Fache . Langdon followed the captain down the famous marble staircase into the sunken atrium beneath a sunken pyramid . Fache's enormous palm wrapped around Langdon's with crushing force .
 The Louvre's newly constructed 70,000-square-foot lobby spread out like an endless grotto . Langdon wondered if Fache had any idea that this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666 . The request had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number of Satan .
 Langdon had been curious at the time but had not felt comfortable demanding specifics . Jacques Sauniere granted very few meetings; Langdon was grateful simply for the opportunity to meet him . The three-hundred-page draft — tentatively titled Symbols of the Lost Sacred Feminine — proposed some very unconventional interpretations of religious iconography .
 As a boy, Langdon suffered a haunting phobia of enclosed spaces . Langdon had fallen down an abandoned well shaft and almost died treading water in the narrow space for hours before being rescued . Captain Fache's tie clip was a silver crucifix with thirteen embedded pieces of black onyx .
 The curator's private office had become DCPJ's makeshift command post for the evening . Fache led Langdon to the Louvre's most popular section — la Grande Galerie — a seemingly endless corridor that housed the most valuable Italian masterpieces . The Louvre would require several hundred technicians simply to monitor the feeds .
 The 133,000-square-foot tower is clad in red brick and Indiana limestone . The second, eighth, and sixthteenth floors contain chapels, ornamented with mill-  work and marble . The seventeenth floor is entirely residential . Opus Dei was the fastest-growing and most financially secure Catholic organization in the world .
 Opus Dei's escalating wealth and power was a magnet for suspicion . Bishop Aringarosa: "Opus DeI is neither a brainwashing cult or a secret society" "We are a Catholic Church. We are a group of Catholics who have chosen as our priority to follow Catholic doctrine"
 The media has referred to the group as "God's Mafia" and "the Cult of Christ" The group enjoyed the full endorsement and blessing of the Vatican, Bishop Aringarosa says . Opus Dei had found itself threatened by a force infinitely more powerful than media .
 Robert Langdon dons an ankle-length, hooded robe and dons it to protect himself . Langdon was staring into the mouth of a long, deep canyon at the Grand Gallery . The Grand Gallery housed the Louvre's most famous Italian art . The floor produced an ephemeral optical illusion — a multi-dimensional network .
 The length of the Grand Gallery is around fifteen hundred feet, the length of three Washington Monuments laid end to end . The muted crimson lighting conjured memories of Langdon' s last experience in noninvasive lighting in the Vatican Secret Archives . This was tonight's second unsettling parallel with his near-death in Rome .
 Jacques Sauniere's left index finger was also bloody, apparently having been dipped into the wound to create the most unsettling aspect of his own macabre deathbed . Using his own blood as ink, and employing his own naked abdomen as a canvas, he drew a simple symbol on his naked abdomen . Langdon: "Pagans" had become almost synonymous with devil worship .
 Langdon: "The pentacle is a pre-Christian symbol that relates to Nature worship" The ancient Greeks envisioned their world in two halves — masculine and feminine . Their gods and goddesses  worked to keep a balance of power . When male and female were balanced, there  was harmony in the world .
 Langdon was frustrated when he saw the symbol in this context; the pentacle's true origins were actually quite godly . Langdon's best guess was that a naked human form was yet another endorsement of Venus — the goddess of human sexuality . "This is very common in times of turmoil," Langdon says .
 Langdon circled the corpse and crouched down, noting with surprise that the curator was clutching a large felt-tipped marker . Langdon knelt down farther to see the pen's label: STYLO DE LUMIERE NOIRE . The stylus wrote in a noncorrosive, alcohol-based fluorescent ink that was visible only under black light .
 Opus Dei's ascension to grace was jump-started in 1982 when Pope John Paul II unexpectedly elevated them to a "personal prelature of the Pope" The wealthy sect allegedly transferred almost one billion dollars into the Vatican's Institute for Religious Works .
 Opus Dei's views on women were medieval at best, says Sister Sandrine . She was shocked to learn that female numeraries were forced to clean the urchmen's residence halls for no pay while the men were at mass . Women slept on hardwood floors while men had straw mats, and women had to endure additional requirements of corporal mortification .
 A dying man had barricaded himself in the gallery, drawn a pentacle on himself, and scrawled a mysterious accusation on the floor . "An accusation against his murderer makes sense, I suppose," Fache says . Sauniere had created a life-sized replica of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketch . The Vitruvian Man had become a modern-day icon of culture .
 Leonardo da Vinci had a "tendency toward the darker arts," Fache says . Da Vinci exhumed corpses to study human anatomy and kept mysterious journals in reverse handwriting . He believed he possessed the alchemic power to turn lead into gold and even cheat God by creating an elixir to postpone death .
 The delicate art of cajoler was a lost skill in modern law enforcement . Few men possessed the necessary sangfroid for this kind of operation, but Fache seemed born for it . Fache attended mass and confession with zealous regularity — far more than the requisite holiday attendance fulfilled by other officials .
 Fache had uploaded photos of the crime scene to the Cryptography Department . Sophie Neveu was one of Fache's biggest mistakes . She had been foisted on Fache two years ago as part of the ministry's attempt to incorporate more women into the police force .
 Robert Langdon thought Bezu Fache was suffering a stroke when his jaw stopped moving and his eyes bulged . Langdon's excitement over the code gave way to a sudden ripple of concern . "You need to contact the U.S. Embassy, Mr. Langdon," Sophie Neveu told Langdon .
 Captain Fache's brow furrowed in apparent confusion, but Sophie had already turned back to Langdon . "Mr. Langdon," she declared, pulling a slip of paper from her pocket, "this is the number for  your embassy's messaging service" Langdon studied the slip with a Paris phone number and extension on it . Fache immediately marched Sophie several steps away and began chastising her .
 His name was not Silas then, although he didn't recall the name his parents had given him . His drunken father, a burly dockworker, beat his mother regularly, blaming her for the boy's embarrassing condition . When the boy tried to defend her, he too was badly beaten . The boy stabbed his father in the back without a word . He was forced to live alone in the basement of a dilapidated factory .
 At 18, in a port town, while attempting to steal a case of cured ham from a cargo ship, he was caught by a pair of crewmen . The two sailors who began to beat him smelled of beer, just as his father had . Over the course of twelve years, his flesh and soul withered until he knew he had become transparent .
 When he awoke the train was moving and a pain was growing in his gut . Food appeared beside his bed, and the ghost ate it, almost able to feel the flesh materializing on his bones . The ghost could not remember the name his parents had given him .
 The Teacher had somehow obtained very secret information . The names of the brotherhood' s four top members! This had been one of the coups that convinced the bishop the Teacher was truly capable of delivering the astonishing prize he claimed he could unearth . The bishop felt renewed confidence that the Teacher and Silas would not fail .
 Bezu Fache despised many things... but a few drew more wrath than the U.S. Embassy . Fache and the ambassador locked horns regularly over shared affairs of state . Almost daily, DCPJ arrested American exchange students in possession of drugs, businessmen for soliciting underage prostitutes .
 The Grand Gallery was a dead end whose only exit was at the other end . The external doors, if opened, would set off fire alarms and were guarded outside by DCPJ agents . Langdon could not possibly leave without Fache knowing about the situation . Fache stormed into the command center at Sauniere's office .
 Fache considered radioing the guards in the entresol and telling them to stop Sophie and drag her back up here . Langdon felt light-headed as he trudged toward the end of the Grand Gallery . Sophie stood before him now, still catching her breath after doubling back to the rest room .
 Langdon had been called to the Louvre tonight not as a symbologist but rather as a suspect . He was the unwitting target of one of DCPJ's favorite interrogation methods . Langdon reached his hand into his tweed jacket's left pocket — one he never used . It was a metallic, button-shaped disk about the size of a watch battery .
 Langdon knew the soluble ink of a watermark stylus could easily be wiped away . "The last line of the message," Sophie said, "was something Fache did not want you to know" Langdon felt as if the floor were tilting beneath his feet . "This is insanity! Fache has no evidence!" Langdon said .
 Sophie Neveu apparently believed the curator had left her a cryptic postscript telling her to find Robert Langdon . "The Vitruvian Man" has always been my favorite Da Vinci sketch, she said flatly . Langdon suddenly sensed that he needed a lawyer .
 Fache was fighting the urge to go check on Langdon . Langdon needed to return of his own volition . "We're still seeing small movements inside the men's room, so the GPS dot is obviously still on him," Collet said . Fache left his handgun in the car and left his gun in the vehicle .
 Sophie pictured her grandfather's body, naked and spread-eagle on the floor . Jacques Sauniere was a stranger to her now . Their relationship had evaporated in a single instant one March night when she was twenty-two . Sophie vowed never to speak to anyone about what she had seen .
 Sophie's parents died when she was four when their car went off a bridge into fast-moving water . Sophie suddenly could hear her own heart: My family is dead, Sophie. They are not coming home . Sophie wondered if her grandfather had fallen terminally ill and had decided to attempt any ploy he could think of to get Sophie to visit him one last time .
 Sophie sensed Langdon had no idea why her grandfather had thrown them together . Langdon's secretary set the meeting and didn't offer any specific reason,  and I didn't ask . Sophie didn't buy it . Her grandfather knew more about pagan iconography than anyone else on earth .
 Sophie needed more time with Langdon, but time was running out . Langdon was about to escape the Louvre, whether he wanted to or not . Sophie needed Langdon for herself, and it was this that left Sophie only one logical conclusion .
 Sophie Neveu is the granddaughter of Jacques Sauniere, the grandson of the late Saunierier . She was upset by the photos of the code and left the office without a word . The bell sounded like it was coming from inside the Grand Gallery . If so, what did it tell her?
 Collet watched the screen in bewilderment as the blinking dot arrived at the window ledge and then did something utterly unexpected . Collet knew Langdon wouldn't get far . There were no trees or grass on the western end of the Denon Wing to cushion a fall .
 Langdon and Sophie stood in the darkness of the Grand Gallery, their backs pressed to one of the large partitions that hid the bathrooms from the gallery . Sophie retrieved a heavy, cylindrical trash can from under the sinks . She drove the bottom of the can into the center of the window, shattering the glass . Langdon hoped Sophie was not thinking what she seemed to be thinking .
 The Church of Saint-Sulpice has the most eccentric history of any building in Paris . Built over the ruins of an ancient temple to the Egyptian goddess Isis . The attached seminary has a well-documented history of unorthodoxy and was once the clandestine meeting hall for numerous secret societies .
 The symbolism of the clues meshed too perfectly — the pentacle, The Vitruvian Man, Da Vinci, the goddess, and even the Fibonacci sequence . Langdon felt like he was trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle in the dark .
 Langdon wished he could comprehend the cryptic message, both for Sophie's well-being and for his own . Sophie: "I'm certain his message at the Louvre was his final effort to tell me something important, something he  thought you could help me understand" Langdon dedicated an entire chapter in his new manuscript to the Tarot .
 Langdon: The number PHI was derived from the Fibonacci sequence . He said it was famous because the quotients of adjacent terms possessed the astonishing property of approaching the number 1.618 — PHI! Despite its seemingly mystical mathematical origins, Langdon explained, the truly mind-boggling aspect of PHI was its role as a fundamental building block in nature .
 Langdon: "Nobody understood better than Da Vinci the divine structure of the human body" Langdon was the  first to show that the  human body is literally made of building blocks whose proportional ratios always equal PHI . The Vitruvian Man is named for Marcus Vitruviius, the brilliant Roman architect who praised the Divine Proportion .
 Langdon unveiled PHI in the architectural dimensions of the Greek Parthenon, the pyramids of Egypt, and the United Nations Building in New York . PHI appeared in the organizational structures of Mozart's sonatas, Beethoven's Fifth ymphony, as well as the works of Bartok, Debussy, and Schubert .
 Langdon: "The Fibonacci sequence is a clue," Langdon says . "You think this message is... une anagramme?" Sophie needed only an instant to process Langdon's implication . The mystical teachings of the Kabbala drew heavily on anagrams .
 Sophie Langdon's grandfather used one of his anagrams to communicate with the Mona Lisa as a code . The famous painting hung in the Salle des Etats — a private viewing chamber accessible only from the Grand Gallery . The doors  opened into the chamber were situated only twenty meters from where her grandfather had  been found dead .
 Sophie's grandfather had written a confidential transmission directly to her . He had written it in code, included her secret initials, and told her to find Robert Langdon . Sophie felt guilty turning Langdon into a fugitive only to abandon him, but she saw no other option . Langdon nodded, eyeing the keys in his hand .
 Sauniere had written Langdon's name on the floor, commanding Sophie to find him . Langdon wondered what Sophie would find at the Mona Lisa... if anything . She seemed certain her grandfather meant  she to visit the famous painting one more time . Saint-Sulpice was built in the shape of a giant Roman cross .
 The Rose Line was a pagan astronomical device like a sundial . The Compass Rose indicated North, East, South, and West . Originally known as the Wind Rose, it denoted the directions of the thirty-two winds . The Rose was associated with maps and guiding souls in the proper direction .
 The zero longitude of the entire world had passed directly through Paris, and through the Church of Saint-Sulpice . The Rose Line was the line from which all other longitudes on earth would be measured . Today that line is in Greenwich, England .
 The Salle des Etats was one of this museum's rare culs-de-sac — a dead end and the only  room off the middle of the Grand Gallery . Sophie had indeed seen the initials P.S. once before, in a kind of monogram . Sophie mustered the courage to sneak into her grandfather's bedroom .
 Sophie was given a red bicycle by her grandfather for Christmas morning . She found a note card lying on her pillow with a simple riddle written on it . Sophie solved the riddle and raced to the next card, solving another riddle . "It opens a box," he finally said .
 Sophie was praying Langdon was not going to tell her that he himself was a member of the Prieure de Sion . Langdon exhaled and lowered his voice . "I've written about this group," he said, his voice tremulous with excitement . Sophie felt a knot tighten in her stomach .
 Langdon had never heard of the Priory's membership of some of history's most cultured individuals: men like Botticelli, Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo . Sophie felt her mind reeling back ten years — to the night she had mistakenly surprised her grandfather and witnessed what she still could not accept . The identities of living Priory members are kept extremely secret .
 The keystone is hidden beneath the Rose Line at the base of the Sulpice obelisk . Bezu Fache felt dumbstruck as he paced the banks of the Seine . He was certain he had seen  Langdon dial a local number, enter a three-digit code, and then listen to a recording .
 The Mona Lisa hung on the northwest wall of the Salle des Etats behind a two-inch-thick pane of protective Plexiglas . Fache's blood was boiling as he typed the numbers 4... 5... 4 . He strained to see beyond the cocoon of purplish colored light emanating from the light in Sophie's hand .
 The Mona Lisa's well-documented collage of double entendres and playful allusions had been revealed in most art history tomes . Yet, incredibly, the public at large still considered her mystery a great mystery . Langdon's jail seminar was part of a Harvard outreach program attempting to bring education into the prison system .
 Langdon: "It carries a subtle message of androgyny. It is a fusing of both" Langdon was not familiar with the brand name, but he was glad to hear the prophylactic phthalactic manufacturers had gotten their hieroglyphs right . Amon is indeed represented as a man with a ram's head and his promiscuity and curved horns are related to our modern sexual slang .
 The Priory's tradition of perpetuating goddess worship is based on a belief that powerful men in the early Christian church 'conned' the world by propagating lies that tipped the scales in favor of the masculine . Sophie remained silent, staring at the words . Langdon understood her meaning: She thinks this is another code .
 During three hundred years of witch hunts, the Church burned at the stake an astounding five million women . Midwives also were killed for their heretical practice of using medical knowledge to ease the pain of childbirth . The once hallowed act of Hieros Gamos — the natural sexual union between man and woman — had been recast as a shameful act .
 The Priory of Sion believed that obliteration of the sacred feminine in modern life had caused what the Hopi Native Americans called koyanisquatsi — "life out of balance" Langdon heard the approaching footsteps out in the hallway . Sophie extinguished the black light and seemed to evaporate before Langdon's eyes .
 Silas laid the stone tablet on the altar and turned his eager hands to the leather Bible . The bloody monk was now quietly donning his cloak again, clutching his prize as he moved toward the altar, toward the Bible . Opus Dei is  searching for the keystone, Sister Sandrine knew .
 Warden Grouard had heard the rumors of the painful falling-out between Sauniere and his granddaughter . Sophie Neveu felt a cold sweat breaking across her forehead . Sophie scanned the area around one masterpiece in particular — another Da Vinci . But the UV light revealed nothing out of the ordinary .
 Sophie pictured the message scrawled on the protective glass of the Mona Lisa . The painting before her had no protective glass on which to write a message . Sophie knew her grandfather would never have defaced this masterpiece by writing on the painting itself . Sophie snatched the key from behind the painting and slipped it in her pocket along with the UV penlight .
 Sophie realized that Leonardo da Vinci, for the second time tonight, was there to help . Grouard screamed, frozen in horror as he watched the priceless Da Vinci stretching . Langdon wondered if Sophie had any idea how valuable a painting  she had almost ruined . The Da ipientVinci was notorious among art historians for its plethora of hidden pagan symbolism .
 Sister Sandrine's private phone numbers stashed beneath her bed were for use on only one condition . She was not supposed to call the fourth number unless the first three could not be reached . If identity of one brother was compromised, he could tell a lie that would start in motion a mechanism to warn the others . The outgoing message offered no name but simply asked the caller to leave a message .
 Sophie gunned the SmartCar up and over a curb onto a gravel divider . Langdon gripped the dash as the car shot out across a sidewalk and bounced back down into the small rotary at Carrousel du Louvre . Sophie had said her grandfather left her something behind the painting . Madonna of the Rocks was yet another fitting link in the chain of interconnected symbolism .
 Leonardo da Vinci's original commission for Madonna of the Rocks had come from an organization known  as the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception . The painting showed a blue-robed Virgin Mary sitting with her arm around an infant child, presumably Baby Jesus .
 The key's complex series of laser-burned pockmarks was examined by an electric eye . Sophie knew of no churches that used laser-tooled varying matrix keys . Sophie's grandfather Jacques Sauniere despised city driving and owned a car for one destination only — his vacation chateau .
 Sophie's grandfather's favorite antique, a sprawling Aubusson tapestry, hung on the east wall beside the fireplace, had been pulled aside on its brass brass rod, exposing the wall behind it . Sophie slipped through the door and found herself on a rough-hewn stone staircase .
 The room was a grotto — a coarse chamber that appeared to have been hollowed from the granite of the hillside . Everyone in the circle rocked back and forth and chanted in reverence to something on the floor . Langdon's voice intruded. Sophie slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt . A hundred yards ahead, the intersection was blocked by a couple of DCPJ police cars .
 Langdon sat white-knuckled in the passenger seat, twisted backward, scanning behind them for any signs of the police . Sophie was fishing in her sweater pocket for a small metal object . Langdon had never seen anything like it . The shaft was pockmarked with hundreds of tiny hexagons that appeared to be finely tooled and scattered at random .
 Langdon wondered again if he might have been better off letting Fache arrest him at the Louvre . Sophie gunned the SmartCar into France's largest rotary, a nine-lane behemoth . Langdon asked Sophie to explain the situation and have the embassy send someone to meet us somewhere . "Robert, you're dreaming. Sending someone to retrieve us would be considered aiding a fugitive of the French government .
 "We won't last another five minutes if we stay in this car," Sophie said . Sophie pulled her SmartCar in behind a line of taxis and parked in a red zone . Bishop Aringarosa recalled a day when all Vatican transports were big luxury cars that sported grille-plate medallions .
 Vatican cars were now less ostentatious and almost always unmarked . Vatican claimed this was to cut costs to better serve dioceses, but Aringarosa suspected it was more of a security measure . Vatican phoned to request Aringaosa's immediate presence in Rome five months ago .
 The Pope's summer residence is Castel Gandolfo, a sixteenth-century citadel that housed the Vatican Observatory . The castle is an impressive example of tiered, defensive architecture . The Vatican has built two huge aluminum telescope domes atop the roof, leaving the building looking like a proud warrior .
 The Vatican's Astronomy Library is rumored to contain more than twenty-five thousand volumes, including rare works of Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Newton and Secchi . Langdon checked his watch at 2:59 A.M. and Sophie raised her eyes to the enormous departure board overhead .
 Langdon examined the cruciform key again, holding it to the window, bringing it close to his eyes to find any markings on it that might indicate where the key had been made . Langdon sniffed the key to his nose and sniffed it to his wife . "It smells like somebody polished it with a cleaner," she said .
 Langdon looked at the smooth surface on the broad arm of the cross . It seemed to shimmer in places... like it was wet . Langdon turned to her, "Do you still have the black light?" Sophie reached in her pocket and produced the UV penlight . There was writing there in penmanship that was hurried but legible .
 The Priory of Sion was founded in Jerusalem in 1099 by a French king named Godefroi de Bouillon . The brotherhood's history spanned more than a millennium... an astonishing chronicle of secrets, blackmail, betrayal, and even brutal torture at the hands of an angry Pope .
 The Priory of Sion learned of a stash of hidden documents buried beneath the ruins of Herod's temple, which had been built atop the earlier ruins of Solomon's Temple . Langdon explains how the Knights were in the Holy Land during the Second Crusade and told King Baldwin II that they were there to protect Christian pilgrims .
 Langdon: "The Knights discovered something down there in the ruins... something that made them wealthy and powerful beyond anyone's wildest imagination" The Knights believed the documents the Priory sought were buried deep under the ruins of the temple . For almost a decade, the nine Knights lived in the . ruins, excavating in total secrecy through solid rock .
 Langdon: "For a thousand years, legends of this secret have been passed on. The entire collection of documents, its power, and the secret it reveals have become known by a single  name — Sangreal" Langdon says the Priory guards the proof, and is purportedly awaiting the right moment in history to reveal the truth .
 Langdon: "According to the Priory of Sion, the Holy Grail is not a cup at all" Sophie sensed in Langdon's patient smile that he empathized with her confusion . Langdon had known this question was coming, and yet he felt uncertain exactly how to tell her .
 The Holy Grail is arguably the most sought-after treasure in human history, Langdon says . The Grail has spawned legends, wars, and lifelong quests . Langdon: "You're a Harvard historian, for God's sake, not a pop schlockmeister looking for a quick buck"
 Langdon groped for the car's controls and hesitated . "Robert," Sophie said from the back seat, "I trust you've seen enough of our magic forest?" He nodded . "Good. Drive us out of here." Sophie yelled .
 The equal-armed cruciform was symbolic of balance and harmony but also of the Knights Templar . The Grail was believed to be buried in a hidden chamber beneath one of the many Templar churches, where it had been hidden since at least 1500 . The last Grail "sighting" had been in 1447 when eyewitnesses described a fire that had almost engulfed the documents .
 The truth was that some unidentified painter had filled in Da Vinci's sketch like a paint-by-numbers years after his death . Photographs taken with infrared reflectography and X ray suggested that this rogue painter had made suspicious departures from the underdrawing . Sophie asked Langdon if the key he was holding unlocks the Holy Grail's hiding place .
 Langdon had entirely forgotten that the peaceful, equal-armed cross had been adopted as the perfect symbol for the flag of neutral Switzerland . The last thing he needed to appear tonight was weak or fearful . The priest who greeted him at the door looked sleepy . He was the same priest who had greeted Aringarosa five months ago .
 The Teacher suggested Aringarosa get the money in Vatican Bank bonds . "Bonds are negotiable as cash anywhere in the world," he said . "You have acted more quickly than we imagined," the secretariat said . The Teacher's suggestion served as insurance for the Bishop .
 Opus Dei is a personal prelature of Vatican City, and His Holiness can disperse monies however he sees fit . The Depository Bank of Zurich offers blind drop services, otherwise known as anonymous safe-deposit boxes . Langdon was traveling with Sophie in a taxi from Zurich to New York .
 Sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank's driveway . A video camera overhead was aimed directly at them, and Langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlike those at the Louvre, was authentic . Sophie took the gold laser-pocked key from her pocket and inserted it, sliding it in until the entire shaft had disappeared . Instantly, the gate began to swing open .
 The message was clear: You are walking into a vault . The gray metal was everywhere — the floor, walls, counters, doors, even the lobby chairs . The dual-language greeting was the newest hospitality trick of the European host . It presumed nothing and opened the door for the guest to reply in whichever language was more comfortable .
 Langdon's first visit to the Swiss safe-deposit box was his first visit . Langdon asked Sophie if she could use the room, and she nodded . "Your key is like a Swiss numbered account, which are often willed through generations"
 Andre Vernet was president of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich . The arrival of a gold key client who was wanted by the Judicial Police would be an extremely delicate matter . If Vernet moved quickly, this impending disaster could be deftly sidestepped .
 Sophie's grandfather, Jacques Sauniere, was murdered in the Louvre . Sophie said she was certain she had seen nothing behind Madonna of the Rocks . Every key is electronically paired with a ten-digit account number that functions as a password . Without that number, your key is worthless .
 Langdon: "Mademoiselle, your family died in a car accident when you were young. I'm sorry. I know your grandfather loved you very much. He mentioned to me several times how much it pained him that you two had fallen out of touch." Langdon asked, "Do the contents of this account have anything to do with the Sangreal?" Langdon said, "I have no idea what that is"
 Sophie needed only to read the first line to know Langdon was correct . The account number was 13-3-2-21-1-8-5 . Sophie realized the Fibonacci numbers were also a clue as to how to decipher the other lines . Langdon: "Looks like we only get one try"
 The Fibonacci sequence was melded into a single ten-digit number, it became virtually unrecognizable . Langdon spotted it, and knew she was right . Sophie reached down and pressed the ENTER key to enter a different number . Underneath the bank's subterranean vault, beneath them, a robotic claw sprang to life . Hundreds of identical plastic crates lay aligned on an enormous grid .
 Sophie and Langdon found a small treasure chest her grandfather had sent them to retrieve . Langdon stared in wonderment at the lid's inlay — a five-petal rose . The dimensions of the box, the apparent weight of its contents, and a Priory symbol for the Grail all seemed to imply one unfathomable conclusion: The Cup of Christ is in this wooden box .
 Langdon and Sophie Langdon were in the Depository Bank of Zurich's vault . Langdon wrapped the item in his jacket as they made their way through the hallways . Sophie and Langdon sat down on the metal floor of the empty steel box .
 Silas fell to his knees before Bishop Aringarosa — the man who had given him a new life — and he said, "I am a lamb of God. Shepherd me as your heart commands" Silas now gazed at the bare floor and feared victory had eluded them .
 Langdon found a marble cylinder in a box filled with silk inside . The cylinder appeared to have been assembled in many pieces . Langdon wished he could call Bishop Aringarosa and warn him, but the Teacher had removed all their lines of direct communication tonight .
 Jacques Sauniere was a talented craftsman who spent hours in his wood and metal shop . He enjoyed imitating master craftsmen like Faberge and Leonardo da Vinci . Da Vinci's robot knight was designed to sit up, wave its arms, and move its head via a flexible neck while opening and closing an anatomically correct jaw .
 Da Vinci had been a cryptology pioneer, Sophie knew, although he was seldom given credit . Langdon's grandfather built cryptexs for him when he was younger . Julius Caesar devised a code-writing scheme called the Caesar Box . Mary, Queen of Scots created transposition cipher and sent secret communiques from prison .
 Langdon says the answer to the riddle was the password to the cryptex . Langdon: The only way to access the information inside is to know the proper five-letter password . In Priory symbolism, the Rose and the Grail are synonymous .
 Langdon choked, a fearful bewilderment sweeping across his face . "Sub... rosa, " he choked . "Under the sign of the Rose," he whispered . Langdon didn't know where to begin . Keystones as a masonry technique for building stone urchways had been one of the best-kept secrets .
 Historians had been searching for the keystone in French churches for the last decade . Leonardo da Vinci — former Grand Master of the Priory of Sion — designed the cryptex . The map to the Holy Grail was incorporated high in an archway of  some forgotten church, mocking the blind churchgoers who wandered beneath it .
 Langdon suddenly recalled her mentioning how her grandfather used to make treasure hunts for her — preuves de merite . Sophie looked unsettled by this, and Langdon nodded . "I forgot you'd had experience with this sort of thing," Sophie said . Langdon could not believe what she had just said .
 The Grand Master of the Priory of Sion had just transferred the brotherhood's legendary keystone to his granddaughter and  commanded her to find Robert Langdon . Langdon's imagination could conjure no set of circumstances that would explain Sauniere's behavior . Andre Vernet had told them he would take them well outside the city to safety .
 A gunshot roared, and a bullet tore into the wall above him . Sophie shook her head. "Don't do it." Langdon froze. "Mr. Langdon, pick up the box." Vernet commanded, "Place the box beside the door" Langdon brushed the shell over the edge onto the narrow ledge .
 Bishop Aringarosa feared his phone might not have been working properly . He feared what the Teacher might think if he had been repeatedly phoning with no answer . He heard the crunching of tires on gravel as the truck's wide wheelbase failed to navigate a turn . The armored car lurched away, its front bumper dragging .
 Langdon realized that any possibility of finding a way to return the keystone to the Priory had just evaporated . News of three additional murders had dire implications . The Priory has been infiltrated. The brotherhood was obviously being watched, or there was a mole within the ranks .
 Langdon gave it a hard kick and sensed he might be able to break it off entirely . Sophie ran her fingers over the dials and rotated the mechanism one by one . Sophie aligned the disks such that her chosen letters lined up between the cryptex's two brass alignment arrows on either end of the cylinder . The letters now spelled a five-letter word that Sophie knew was absurdly obvious .
 Leigh Teabing was a Grail researcher and a descendant of Britain's First Duke of Lancaster . Sophie claimed her grandfather was the actual Grand Master of the Priory of Sion . "Teabing could be a powerful ally," Langdon said. "Fache probably will be offering a monetary reward"
 Despite its ensemble cast and well-documented evidence, the premise rubbed so hard against the grain of popular Christian thought that it instantly confronted a firestorm of hostility . Shortly afterward, Langdon received a postcard from an old friend — the Catholic Bishop of Philadelphia .
 The 185-acre estate of Chateau Villette was located twenty-five minutes northwest of Paris . Designed by Francois Mansart in 1668 for the Count of Aufflay, it was one of Paris's most significant historical chateaux .
 Langdon had found him such a lively and colorful man on his last visit that it hardly seemed an infirmity . "Those who seek the truth are more than friends. They are brothers." Langdon rolled his eyes at Sophie, well accustomed to Teabing's predilection for dramatic antics .
 Langdon and Sophie drove the armored truck up the winding, poplar-lined driveway toward the  house . Chateau Villette is a private, gated estate owned by  a good-natured foreigner . Sophie looked dubious, but Langdon said, "Not to worry," "I'll find somewhere inside to hide this before he joins us"
 The air inside smelled antediluvian, regal somehow, with traces of pipe tobacco, tea leaves, cooking sherry, and earthen aroma of stone architecture . Langdon unwrapped the cryptex from his coat, walked to the velvet divan, slid the wooden box underneath it, out of sight .
 Sir Leigh Teabing arrived at the bottom of the stairs, appearing to Sophie no more like a knight than Sir Elton John . He wore pleated pants and a roomy silk shirt under a paisley vest . "Perhaps Robert told you I schooled just down the road at Oxford," he said .
 Langdon asked Leigh Teabing to talk to her about the Priory of Sion . "We might have a better idea if we could get some information from you first," Langdon said . Sophie drank her tea and ate a scone, feeling the welcome  effects of caffeine and food .
 The Bible, as we know it today, was collated by the pagan Roman emperor Constantine the Great . Teabing: "The bible is a product of man, my dear. Not of God" Langdon: "Everything you need to know about the Bible can be summed up by the great canon doctor Martyn Percy"
 The pre-Christian God Mithras was born on December 25, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days . December 25 is also the birthday of Osiris, Adonis, and Dionysus . The newborn Krishna was presented with gold, frankincense, and myrrh .
 Teabing: Constantine upgraded Jesus' status almost four centuries after Jesus' death . Those who 'chose' the original history of Christ were the  world's first heretics . The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in the 1950s hidden in a cave near Qumran in the Judean desert .
 The Last Supper is the entire key to the Holy Grail mystery, says Teabing . The Vatican is made up of deeply pious men who truly believe these contrary documents could only be false testimony . Langdon: "The modern Church's desire to suppress these documents comes from a sincere belief in their view of Christ"
 The Grail is literally the ancient symbol for womanhood, Teabing says . The Holy Grail represents the sacred feminine and the goddess, he says . Langdon: "The more penises you have, the higher your rank. Boys will be boys"
 Lt. Collet radioed the five cars accompanying him to Langdon's location . "No sirens, men. Langdon can't know we're coming," Collet said . Langdon was about to make the most high-profile arrest of his career .
 Sophie felt as if the entire night had become some kind of twilight zone where nothing was as she expected . The Last Supper is a painting of  thirteen men . Sophie could not take her eyes from the woman beside Christ . The individual had flowing red hair, delicate folded hands, and the hint of a bosom .
 The Last Supper practically shouts at the viewer that Jesus and Magdalene were a pair, Teabing says . Jesus wore a red robe and blue cloak; Mary Magdelene wore a blue robe and red cloak . Sophie saw it at once. Glaring in the center of the painting was an enormous, flawlessly formed letter M .
 Sophie Langdon's grandfather, Richard Teabing, has written a book about the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene . Sophie: "Jesus as a married man makes infinitely more sense than our standard  If Jesus were not married, at least one of the Bible's gospels would have mentioned it"
 The Last Temptation of Christ was about Jesus having sex with a lady called Mary Magdalene . Sophie Teabing found her grandfather's name on an article on the second page of the paper . The priest yelled, "How can you possibly endorse that! This American Martin Scorsese is a blasphemer, and  the Church will permit him no pulpit in France !
 Langdon: According to these unaltered gospels, it was not Peter to whom Christ gave directions with which  to establish the Christian Church . Sophie: Magdalene was recast as a whore in order to erase evidence of her powerful family ties . Teabing: "Mary Magdalenes was of royal descent"
 Bishop Aringarosa's daily schedule showed him in New York this weekend, yet he sounded a world away . Receptionist in the lobby of the Opus Dei headquarters was surprised to hear his voice on the line . The bishop quickly severed the connection, and wondered why he sounded crackly .
 The Holy Grail is Mary Magdalene... the mother of the royal bloodline of Jesus Christ . The more pieces Langdon and Teabing laid on the table tonight, the more unpredictable this puzzle became . Sophie felt a new wave of disorientation as she stood in the silence of the ballroom .
 The Church, in order to defend itself against the Magdalene's power, perpetuated her image as a whore and buried evidence of Christ's marriage to her, thereby defusing any potential claims that Christ had a surviving bloodline and was a mortal prophet . The Rose has always been the premiere symbol of female sexuality .
 The Sangreal documents include tens of thousands of pages of information . In those trunks are reputed to be the Purist Documents, written by the early followers of Jesus . Also rumored to be part of the treasure is the legendary "Q" Document — a book of Jesus' izations, possibly written in His own hand .
 The early Church feared that if the lineage were permitted to grow, the secret of Jesus and Magdalene would surface and challenge Catholic doctrine . Christ's line grew quietly under cover in France until making a bold move in the fifth century, when it intermarried with French royal blood . Many of the Vatican's Grail quests were in fact stealth missions to erase members of the royal bloodline .
 Sophie felt hollow as she listened to the clicking of Teabing's crutches fade down the hallway . Sophie turned and faced Langdon in the deserted ballroom . Langdon: "Sauniere is not a Merovingian name." Sophie wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or disappointed .
 "The Grail story is everywhere, but it is hidden," Langdon said . Walt Disney loved infusing hidden messages and symbolism in his art . Most of Disney's hidden messages dealt with religion, pagan myth, and stories of the subjugated goddess .
 The Little Mermaid was a spellbinding tapestry of spiritual symbols so specifically goddess-related that they could not be coincidence . Langdon suspected this was more of a cartoonist's ophomoric prank than any kind of enlightened allusion to pagan human sexuality .
 A man on crutches entered, yelled at Langdon, threw  open the doors, and demanded his guests leave . If they did not reveal where they had placed the keystone, Silas would have to enter and persuade them with force . Langdon: "The keystone reveals the pathway to the brotherhood's ultimate treasure"
 All four top members of the Priory ishlyof Sion were killed in a well-planned decapiter, Sophie says . Langdon: "Rome has been seeking the Grail for centuries" Sophie: "If they never divulged the secret, and they were killed, the location of the keystone would be lost forever!"
 Robert Teabing: "I sense a desperation in this assault on the Priory" Langdon: Why would members of the Catholic clergy murder Priory members in an effort to find and destroy documents they believe are false testimony anyway? Sophie: "The ivory towers of Harvard have made you soft, Robert. Yes, the clergy in Rome are blessed with potent faith"
 Astrological prophecy never held much interest or credibility for Langdon . He knew there were those in the Church who followed it very closely . Now that we've passed into the Age of Aquarius, "End of Days has arrived," he said .
 Sophie pulled the cruciform key from her sweater pocket and held it out to Teabing . "Impossible! What church did I miss? I've searched every church in France!" Langdon said, "It was stored in a rosewood box inlaid with a five-petal Rose"
 Captain Fache wanted to be sure his own face got equal time with Langdon's arrest . Lt. Collet's job was simply to hold down the fort until the boss showed up to save the day . In law enforcement, hesitating to arrest a fugitive only occurred when uncertainty had arisen regarding suspect's guilt . Fache had gone out on a limb tonight to arrest Robert Langdon — surveillance cachee, Interpol, and now television .
 Lt. Collet was speechless . He prayed this was some kind of bizarre coincidence, but he knew it could not be . The armored truck is how Langdon and Neveu got away from the bank, agent said . Hundreds of miles to the south, a chartered Beechcraft Baron 58 raced northward . The Rose is Magdalene is the Holy Grail .
 The key to finding the Holy Grail lies inside a stone cylinder, crafted of interconnecting dials . Langdon had no idea how to open the cylinder, but sensed his own destiny lay inside . The light caught what appeared to be a small hole on the underside of the lid .
 Langdon heard something clatter quietly onto the table . engraved in the wood, written in an immaculate hand, were four lines of text in a language he had never seen . The characters look vaguely Semitic, Langdon thought . Sophie felt helpless as the monk reached out to take the cylinder .
 Robert Langdon had heard the gunshot . He'd also heard a scream of pain . A jackhammer was boring a hole into the back of Langdon's cranium . Langdon drifted out again and Langdon was rescued by a knight brandishing an Excalibur made by Acme Orthopedic .
 Police burst through the front door of Sir Leigh Teabing's estate with guns drawn . They found a bullet hole  on the drawing room floor, signs of a struggle, a small amount of blood, a strange, barbed leather belt, and a partially used roll of duct tape . The entire level seemed deserted .
 The Range Rover was Java Black Pearl, four-wheel drive, standard transmission, with high-strength polypropylene lamps, rear light cluster fittings . Langdon was pleased he was not driving . Teabing's manservant Remy was doing an impressive job of euvering the vehicle across the moonlit fields behind Chateau Villette .
 Langdon forced a pained smile as he cradled the keystone in the passenger seat . "So glad you popped in this evening, Robert," Teabing said, grinning as if he were having fun for the first time in years . "Sorry to get you involved in this, Leigh."
 Richard Teabing dialed the car phone on the dash . "My plane cost me a Queen's ransom," he said . "I am finished with France. I moved here to find the keystone. I shan't care if I ever again see Chateau Villette"
 All he could think of was the keystone, the inscription, and whether it would all lead to the Grail . He wondered if Teabing was right about Britain . "Just because I am returning to the Queen's realm  does not mean I intend to subject my palate to bangers and mash for the rest of my days"
 Langdon's captors have the keystone! They will reach the Grail before we do! In the stifling darkness,  Silas prayed . He let the pain of his body fuel his supplications . He had no way even to contact them and tell them the terrible turn of events .
 Langdon: "I took no position on the Priory's actions" Sophie: "If Captain Fache didn't find the envelope in which your editor sent the manuscript, he would have to conclude that you sent it and lied about it" Langdon shrugged: "A cruel coincidence, my friend," Langdon said .
 Sophie thought I'm fleeing the country, Sophie thought, her body forced back into the leather seat . Sophie had believed her game of cat and mouse with Fache would be somehow justifiable to the Ministry of Defense . Sophie was attempting to protect an innocent man. Sophie was trying to fulfill my  grandfather's dying wishes .
 Teabing: "Understandably, you feel obliged to follow the trail wherever it leads" Langdon: "They have been waiting for the right moment in history to share their secret" Sophie: "The monk's purpose is the Church's purpose"
 Langdon intervened, "The task of saving the Holy Grail clearly includes carrying out the Priory's final wishes of sharing the truth with the world" Langdon: "To quote your words, 'You do not find the Grail, the Grail finds you,' I am going to trust that the Grail has found me for a reason, and when the time comes, I will know what to do"
 The takeoff had been unscheduled, and no flight plan had been logged . Langdon's first guess is a Semitic, but now I'm not so sure . "Probably ancient," Teabing offered. "Nekkudot?" Sophie inquired. "Most primary Semitics include nekkudot. This has none." Langdon was still hovering over the script .
 Bill Gates had returned to his alma mater to lend to the museum one of his priceless acquisitions . The Codex Leicester is one of Leonardo's most fascinating notebooks . Despite being beautifully preserved and  meticulously preserved, the codex looked like gibberish .
 Robert Langdon felt the physical world fade away as all of his thoughts converged on Sauniere's mirror-image poem . Langdon read the verse slowly. An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll... and helps us keep her scatter' d family whole .
 Langdon: "A headstone praised by Templars is the key" "We have no idea where Magdalene's tomb is," Sophie says . The Atbash Cipher was a simple substitution code based on the twenty-two-letter Hebrew alphabet . In Atbash, the first letter was substituted by the last letter, the second letter by the next to last letter .
 Text encrypted with Atbash is found throughout  the Kabbala, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and even the Old Testament . Sophie sensed from the grim look on Langdon's face that finding the Templar headstone would be no small feat . Sophie feared that what they eventually found inside this cryptex would not be as simple as "a map to the Holy Grail"
 Fache checked his watch and gazed out at the scattering of jets parked in front of the terminal . Langdon's head still throbbed where he'd been hit by the monk . Teabing was still in the back of the plane . Sophie told Langdon she saw something that convinced her grandfather was in a secret society .
 The Hieros Gamos ritual is not a perversion, it's a deeply sacrosanct ceremony, Langdon says . Intercourse was the revered union of the two halves of the human spirit . Sex begot new life — the ultimate miracle — and miracles could agicallybe performed only by a god .
 Men seeking spiritual wholeness came to the Temple to visit priestesses — or hierodules — with them they made love and experienced the divine through physical union . The early Church worked hard to demonize sex and recast it as a disgusting and sinful act . Other major religions did the same, Langdon said .
 Sophie felt herself drifting back to the woods outside her grandfather's Normandy chateau . She watched as the strangers swayed and chanted by flickering orange candles . The stone walls of the grotto imprisoned Sophie as the chanting rose to a fever pitch . Sophie wanted to turn and run, but she couldn't .
 Father Aringarosa walked to the cockpit and said he needed to change destinations . "I have to get to London immediately," he said . Pilot eyed the bishop's gold ring . Sophie Neveu was shaken from recounting her experience of Hieros Gamos . Langdon popped a Coke and turned to the window, his thoughts awash with images of secret rituals and unbroken codes .
 Langdon willed the light of day to bring with it a second kind of illumination, but the lighter it became outside, the further he felt from the truth . Langdon explained to Sophie that Baphomet was a pagan fertility god associated with the creative force of reproduction . "Baphomet" was represented as that of a ram or goat, a common symbol of procreation .
 Traditional American Thanksgiving tables still bore pagan fertility symbols . The cornucopia or "horn of plenty" was a tribute to Baphomet's fertility . Langdon felt a rising thrill that he imagined must have rivaled the thrill felt by early scholars when they first used the Atbash Cipher to decrypt the Mystery of Sheshach .
 Sheshach, in Hebrew, was spelled: Sh-Sh-K. When placed in the substitution matrix, it became B-B-L . In Hebrew, Baphomet in Hebrew without the vowels reads: B-P-V-M-Th .
 Sophie knew that if this cryptex were like those she had opened in her youth, all she would need to do is grip the cylinder at both ends, just beyond the dials, and pull, applying slow, steady pressure . Sophie's outward force on the ends would be transferred to a hinged lever, which would pivot downward into the cavity and apply pressure to the glass vial, eventually shattering it if she pulled too hard . According to Teabing, it contained a map
 On the table sat a second cryptex, made of black onyx, nested within the first . Written in ornate penmanship was another four-line verse . The remainder of the poem clearly implied that the password for opening the second  cryptex could be found by visiting this knight's tomb, somewhere in the city . Langdon felt the web of symbolism stretching onward .
 Collet found notations scrawled in English describing a cathedral's long hollow nave as a secret pagan tribute to a woman's womb . "Kind of makes you want to go back to church," the examiner said . Collet picked up the second evidence bag, a photo of a Gothic cathedral's entrance .
 The keystone has been found in the bank's president, Andre Vernet, who is involved in the hunt for the missing person . Lieutenant Collet calls Interpol and requests every shred of information they can find on the bank . Langdon and Sophie looked on as Teabing got up and went to the far side of the cabin to reveal a discreetly hidden wall safe .
 The landing gear descended with a clunk and the plane was parked in front of the terminal . Teabing sensed that if they were to have any chance of postponing confrontation with the British authorities long enough to find the Grail, bold action had to be taken . Langdon: "I guess Fache still thinks I'm his man."
 Customs agents accepted large tips from Teabing in exchange for turning a blind eye to the transport of harmless organics . British police did not generally carry weapons, but the gravity of the situation had brought an armed response team . Eight policemen with handguns stood just inside the terminal building, awaiting the moment when the plane's engines powered down . A runway attendant would place safety wedges under the tires so the plane could no longer move .
 The Kent chief inspector offered Simon Edwards a chance to inspect the plane . Teabing's manservant Remy appeared in the doorway at the top of the stairs . "Is this one of  those hidden camera programs? Jolly good!" The chief inspector never flinched .
 Kent chief inspector felt distaste for Leigh Teabing as he hobbled around him in defiance . "My lawyers will fricassee your testicles for breakfast. And if you dare board my plane without a warrant, your spleen will follow" The inspector found no traces of anyone hiding... much less individuals .
 Langdon and Sophie crouched on the floor beside the bound and gagged albino . Moments earlier, as the Hawker taxied into the deserted hangar, Remy popped the hatch as the plane jolted to a stop halfway through its turn . With the police closing in fast, Langdon dragged the monk down the gangway to ground level and out of sight behind the limousine . Sophie unwrapped the vellum and handed the sheet to Langdon .
 Langdon thought of the notorious Templar round-up in 1307 when Pope Clement killed and interred hundreds of Knights Templar . The Temple Church was built in London by the Priory's military arm — the Knights Templar themselves . If the missing orb revealed the password, they would be able to open the second cryptex .
 A five-letter word that speaks of the Grail? Langdon eyed the poem again . He had a hard time imagining what they might find inside . The fact that the word was eluding a specialist like Leigh Teabing signified to Langdon that it was no ordinary Grail reference .
 Langdon felt a squeeze on his knee, pulling him back, and Sophie's green eyes were on him . Langdon: "Somehow I feel closer to my grandfather tonight than I have in years" Sophie: "There's an enormous difference between hypothetically discussing an alternate history of Christ, and presenting to the world thousands of ancient documents as scientific evidence that the New Testament is false testimony"
 The Temple Church was consecrated on the tenth of February in 1 185 by Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem . Langdon: "Religious allegory has become apart of the fabric of reality" Sophie: "I would love to see religious scholars have more information to ponder the exceptional life of Jesus Christ"
 The Temple Church survived eight centuries of political turmoil, the Great Fire of London, and the First World War, only to be heavily damaged by Luftwaffe incendiary bombs in 1940 . The church's entryway was a recessed stone niche inside which stood a large wooden door . To the left of the door, hung a bulletin board covered with concert schedules and religious service announcements .
 Every year Sir Christopher Wren's descendants bring a pinch of the old man's ashes to scatter in the Temple sanctuary . It is part of his  last will and testament . He had made possible all the restorations following damage caused by the Great Fire .
 "The Knights Templar were warriors," Teabing reminded Langdon . Langdon agreed, even from here, the walls looked unusually robust . "The Templars invented the concept of modern banking. They were the original ATMs," he said . "I thought Caesar was dead in that scene," Langdon said .
 Remy Legaludec finds a trussed monk in the back of his limousine in a rubbish-strewn alley in London . The monk emerges from a prayer-like trance, his red eyes more curious than fearful . Remy was impressed with this trussed man's ability to stay calm .
 Police captain Fache had a full confession, including a description of the bound albino monk . "I searched the plane myself," the inspector insisted, "and there was no one inside" Fache needed only sixty seconds to locate an anomalous smear of blood near where the limousine had been parked .
 Sophie wondered if the ritual had been performed in this very sanctuary . Bishop Aringarosa is en route to London . Fache's phone rang, and he wished for a moment's peace . Everyone was now on the lookout for a black Jaguar limousine .
 Sophie noted that two of the knights wore tunics over their armor, while the other three wore ankle-length robes . The tomb was a sealed stone casket, not a knight lying in the open air . The coffin looks like it was carved at the same time and by the same sculptor as the other nine tombs .
 Langdon: "Yes, the poem definitely references a tomb. Not an effigy." "Could the poem be wrong?" Teabing asked . "Could Jacques Sauniere have made the same mistake I just did?" Langdon considered it and shook his head .
 "Your only concern," Silas said calmly, "is that I leave here with the keystone" Langdon held the black cryptex before him, waving it back and forth like a matador tempting a dumb animal . Silas pushed Sophie away from him and aimed the gun at Langdon, moving toward him . Langdon raised the cryptex high over his head, threatening to smash it on the floor .
 The monk's red eyes filled with anger and frustration . Remy tightened with fear that Silas might actually shoot Langdon . The cryptex was to be Remy's ticket to freedom and wealth . Remy's association with Sir Leigh Teabing — the preeminent Grail historian on  earth — was going to bring Remy everything he had ever dreamed of in life .
 Sir Leigh Teabing's heart practically stalled to see Remy aiming a gun at him . Remy circled behind him and rammed the pistol barrel into his back, high and on the left, directly behind his heart . "Arrogant fools," Remy sneered . "Why do you want the Grail?" Langdon demanded . "To destroy it? Before the End of Days?" Remy called to the monk .
 Interpol said Vernet's name appeared in the newspapers from time to time, but always in a positive light . Only red flag tonight from Interpol had been a set of fingerprints that apparently belonged to Teabing's servant . Chief PTS examiner was reading the report in a comfortable chair across the  room . He glanced up, chuckling, "Peanut allergy"  An unsuspecting patron had died of anaphylactic shock at  the table after a single bite .
 Langdon felt utterly spent as he and Sophie hurdled a turnstile at Temple tube station and dashed deep into the grimy labyrinth of tunnels and platforms . Langdon knew these recording systems were generally placed in offices . "Reception method?" Collet asked . "Simple radio wave. Small antenna on the roof"
 Sophie would make Remy and Silas fugitives of the London police, forcing them into hiding or catching them . Langdon's guilt ripped through him as he followed Sophie to the westbound District and Circle Line platform, where she hurried to call the police . Sophie's connection to the detective seemed to be taking forever .
 Bezu Fache bellowed as the train thundered into the station . Sophie hung up and dashed with Langdon onto the train . Fache found a stone cylinder with lettered dials spelling SOFIA inside it . The five dials were arranged to spell the word .
 "The contents of the box are immaterial," Vernet fired back . "I am concerned with the reputation of my bank. We have never had a robbery. Ever," he said . "Have you heard any of the audio files?" "A few. Here's one of the most recent."
 Silas waited for Remy to finish tying and gagging Leigh Teabing in back with rope they had found in trunk . Remy climbed out of the rear of the limo, walked around, and slid into the driver's seat . "Ferme ta gueule!" Remy shouted over his shoulder at the crumpled figure .
 The Teacher said: "Take Silas to the Opus Dei residence hall and drop him off a few streets away . Then drive to St. James's Park. It is adjacent to Parliament and Big Ben . King's College's Religion Department boasts 150 years' experience in teaching and research .
 Langdon and Sophie had decided to share just the  first two lines of the poem to an outsider . Compartmentalized cryptography, Sophie had called it "the cryptex" When an intelligence agency intercepted a code containing sensitive data, cryptographers each worked on a discrete section of the code . This way, when they broke it, no single cryptographer had the entire deciphered message .
 Over the past two decades, King's College Research Institute in Systematic Theology had used optical character recognition software in unison with linguistic translation devices to digitize and catalog an enormous collection of texts . Because the massive collection was now in the form of uablybits and bytes rather than physical pages, the data was infinitely more accessible .
 Langdon asked Pamela Gettum if she could find out who this knight is and where he is buried . She replied, "Might I ask where  this verse came from? And why you are seeking an orb?" Langdon said, "It's a long story and we have very little time"
 Silas wondered about Teabing, whom Remy had left bound in the back of the limousine . St. James's Park is a sea of green in the middle of London . Once enclosed by King Henry VIII and stocked with deer for the hunt, the park is now open to the public .
 The swelling in Remy's throat came on like an earthquake, and he lurched against the steering column, grabbing his throat and tasting vomit in his narrowing esophagus . The Teacher reached for the glove box and pulled out the tiny Medusa revolver . For an instant, Remy felt a surge of fear, but the Teacher simply slipped it in his trousers pocket .
 The Teacher feared all along that Remy might need to be eliminated when  the mission was complete, but by brazenly showing himself in the Temple Church, Remy had accelerated the necessity dramatically . Nobody could incriminate the Teacher unless Remy talked, and that was no longer a concern . Minutes later, the Teacher was crossing St. James's Park, he could see his destination .
 The Opus Dei Centre in London is located at 5 Orme Court . Pamela Gettum was in the adjoining room preparing hot drinks . Langdon had no idea what she had just said, but he clicked anyway . The computer will display your keyword hits along with mono prelogs and triple postlogs .
 Langdon knew it was no coincidence  that the word minstrel and minister shared an etymological root . The troubadours were  traveling servants or "ministers" of the Church of Mary Magdalene . Langdon wondered how many modern card players had any clue that their four suits — spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds — were Grail-related symbols that came from Tarot's four suits of swords, cups, scepters, and pentacles
 Silas had no idea what had awoken him or how long he had been asleep . He listened to the quiet breathing of the Opus Dei residence hall, the stillness textured only by the soft murmurs of someone praying in a room below him . The first police officer stormed through, swinging his gun left then right at what appeared to be an empty room .
 Westminster Abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church . Designed in the style of the great cathedrals of Amiens, Chartres, and Canterbury . It bears the classification of royal peculiar, subject only to the Sovereign . Since hosting the coronation of William the Conqueror on Christmas Day in 1066, the sanctuary has witnessed an endless procession of royal events .
 Langdon wanted to bring the London police with them, but Sophie's fears of who might be involved put a damper on any contact with the authorities . Langdon couldn't shake the image of Leigh Teabing being held captive, probably tied up in the back of his own limousine .
 The Teacher pondered Sauniere's beguiling riddle: You seek the orb that ought to be on his tomb . Massive orb protruding from the face of the pyramid was carved in basso-relievo and depicted all  kinds of heavenly bodies .
 The Teacher slipped the cryptex back in his pocket and watched warily as the visitors went to a nearby table, left a donation in the cup, and restocked on the complimentary grave-rubbing supplies set out by the abbey . Langdon and Sophie would eventually decipher the poem's meaning, but this was sooner than he had imagined .
 Langdon and Sophie moved slowly down the north aisle, keeping to the shadows behind the ample pillars that separated it from the open nave . The sarcophagus was recessed in a niche, obscured from this oblique angle . The only link between the planets and the Grail that Langdon could imagine  was the pentacle of Venus .
 Langdon felt a shiver of potential . Sophie spotted a charcoal pencil on the sarcophagus lid near Newton's foot . A careless tourist had left a charcoal, grave-rubbing charcoal pencil . Langdon wished he had some idea about the cryptex password... something to negotiate .
 Langdon remembered the Chapter House as a huge octagonal hall where the original British Parliament convened in the days before the modern Parliament building was built . The Pyx Chamber and St. Faith's Chapel were cordoned off by an official-looking sign . Langdon felt the familiar uneasiness he always felt in enclosed spaces .
 The Chapter House was a kind of satellite structure — a freestanding annex at the end of the long hallway to ensure the privacy of Parliament proceedings housed there . Langdon had forgotten just how large this room was . After the gloomy cloisters, the Chapter House felt like a solarium .
 Langdon: "I learned that the Priory had decided not to release the truth after all" Sophie felt a fury rising from deep within . "Your grandfather sold out to the Church. It is obvious they pressured him to keep the truth quiet." Sophie shook her head. "The Church had no influence on my grandfather!"
 Sophie flashed on her grandfather's overprotectiveness, how he never liked to leave her alone when she was young . Langdon argued, "certainly you have no proof that the Church had  anything to do with those deaths" Langdon could not fathom that Leigh Teabing would be capable of killing them in cold blood .
 The dials were still in random order, and the cryptex remained locked . Langdon eyed Teabing, "How do you know I won't smash it right now?" "I should have realized your threat to break it in the Temple Church was an empty one," he said .
 The Temple Church was the perfect location to steal the keystone from Robert and Sophie . Its apparent relevance to the poem made it a plausible decoy . Remy's orders had been clear — stay out of sight while Silas recovers keystone . If only Remy had not revealed himself, Teabing thought .
 A simple anonymous tip to the police was all it would take to remove Silas from the picture . Teabing's leg braces, crutches, and gun  had set off the metal detector at Westminster Abbey . He presented the flustered guards with an embossed card identifying him as Knight of the Realm .
 Opus Dei will no longer be considered a prelature of the Vatican six months from today, six months after today . The Vatican's Secretariat Council voted unanimously to revoke the Vatican's sanction  of the group . Bishop Aringarosa was stupefied. "Certainly you cannot be surprised it has come to this," he said .
 Opus Dei will be given six months to voluntarily break away from Vatican . Bishop Aringarosa had hoped only a handful of Vatican power brokers knew of the impending annulment . Cardinal: "Third-century laws are not workable in today's society" "And I'll tell him that in person!"
 Robert Langdon's years in the classroom had not imbued him with any skills relevant to handling confrontations at gunpoint . Langdon hoped his focus on the cryptex signaled Teabing that collaboration might be an option, and that his silence signaled Sophie he had not abandoned her .
 Sir Leigh Teabing had suspected Langdon might hold the key to the Holy Grail . He launched his plan into action on the same night Langdon was scheduled to meet Jacques Sauniere . The Grand Master was summoning Langdon to silence him . The Truth has been silenced long enough!
 The mention of Sophie Neveu's name had been the catalyst for Teabing's action . He ordered Silas  to come see him immediately in the safest location Sauniere knew — his Louvre office . Then he phoned Sophie to warn her she might be in danger . Langdon says he knows where to look on Newton's tomb . "I think I can find the password!" Sophie says, "I'm not going anywhere"
 Langdon and Neveu were nothing but a threat to Teabing now... and to the Grail . Sophie's eyes looked as if they would well with tears, but they did not . Sophie said, "How? By unveiling the secret my grandfather died trying to protect? He trusted you, Robert."
 Time seemed to freeze, morphing into a slow-motion dream . The acrid tang of vinegar cut the air, and Teabing felt the cool liquid flowing out through the dials onto his palm . Langdon reached into the breast pocket of his tweed coat and carefully extracted  a delicate rolled papyrus .
 "Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh. You  taught me that," says Langdon . Fache suspected the wily historian was setting the stage for his lawyers to plead an insanity defense . The actual surveillance had been carried out by his manservant, Remy . Some of Fache's intended targets received lavish gifts of artwork, others unwittingly bid at auctions in which Teabing had placed specific lots .
 Last night had been the darkest night of Bishop Aringarosa's life . Bezu Fache had questioned the bishop about his apparent connection to a nun who had been murdered in Saint-Sulpice . The only way to  stop the horrific chain of events he had helped put in motion was to confess everything to Fache .
 Captain Bezu Fache has successfully arrested the man responsible for the murder of Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu . Lieutenant Collet says he suspects Langdon was part of a ruse to lure out the real killer . Rosslyn Chapel stands seven miles south of Edinburgh, Scotland, on the site of an ancient Mithraic temple .
 Rosslyn Chapel seemed far too obvious a location for the Holy Grail . Ground-penetrating radar revealed the presence of an astonishing subterranean chamber beneath the chapel . Archaeologists petitioned to begin excavations through the bedrock to reach the chamber . The Rosslyn Trust expressly forbade any excavation of the sacred site .
 The Knights Templar had designed Rosslyn Chapel as an exact architectural blueprint of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem . Every surface in the chapel had been carved with symbols — Christian cruciforms, Jewish stars, Masonic seals, Templar crosses, cornucopias, pyramids, astrological signs, plants, vegetables, pentacles, and roses .
 Rosslyn Chapel was a shrine to all faiths... to all traditions... and, above all, to nature and the goddess . The two pillars are replicas of the two pillars that stood at the head of Solomon's  Temple . Langdon says they are the most duplicated architectural structures in history .
 Sophie's grandfather's final verse made a direct reference to the Master Masons who adorned Rosslyn with their carved artistic offerings . Langdon had already explained to Sophie about the Templars' historic ties to the modern Masonic secret societies . "There's a code here!" Sophie blurts, in sudden revelation . "It's on the ceiling," she said, turning to the right-hand wall .
 Langdon had been scanning the chapel walls and feeling a rising wariness that a dead end might be looming . Sophie wandered off to look at the code and left Langdon holding the rosewood box, which contained a Grail map . The poem made reference to a "blade and chalice," which Langdon saw nowhere . Langdon knew the young man must be mistaken .
 Langdon's heart pounded as he approached the fieldstone house . The docent recoiled, a look of bewilderment in his olive-green eyes . Langdon: "They died when I was young. In a car accident. My  entire family died that day." Sophie wanted to run, but she stood transfixed .
 Langdon had offered to give Sophie and her grandmother  time to talk in private, but Marie had asked him to stay and listen . Langdon stood alone on the porch of the fieldstone house enjoying the sounds of laughter and reunion drifting through the screened door behind him . "You slipped out quietly," a voice behind him said .
 Langdon could not escape the hollow gnaw of Rosslyn's unsolved mystery . Is the Grail really here at Rosslyn? And if so, where are the blade and chalice that Sauniere mentioned in his poem? Langdon sensed the story went far deeper, but he also sensed it was not for him to hear .
 Marie Chauvel: "There is nothing in the Priory doctrine that identifies a date at which the Grail should be unveiled" Langdon: "If the Sangreal documents remain hidden, the story of Mary Magdalene will be lost forever" Chauvel traced a shape on her palm on the floor of Rosslyn Chapel . Langdon asked, "Why is it that men simply cannot let the Grail rest?"
 The Star of David... the perfect union of male and female... Solomon's Seal... marking the Holy of the Holies . Langdon stopped short, mute with amazement as it dawns on him . Marie laughed . The keystone is supposed to point to the place where the Holy Grail is hidden now, Langdon asked .
 Sophie asked Langdon to stay with her family for a few days . She said she wanted to meet him in Florence for a week without much to do . Langdon cringed at how it had sounded . "You presume a lot, Mr. Langdon," Sophie said .
 The Sphinx was conceived and commissioned in the 1980s by the Sphinx himself, Francois Mitterrand, a man rumored to move in secret circles . Langdon had once followed the line from Sacre-Coeur, north across the Seine, to the ancient Paris Observatory .
 The Carrousel du Louvre was once the site of Paris's primeval nature-worshipping festivals . Langdon felt as if he were crossing into another world as he stepped over the bushes to the grassy area within . Directly before him, hanging down from above, gleamed the inverted pyramid — a breathtaking V-shaped contour of glass .
 The quest for the Holy Grail is the quest to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene . Robert Langdon heard Marie Chauvel's words . Langdon was standing beneath the ancient Rose Line, surrounded by the work of masters .
