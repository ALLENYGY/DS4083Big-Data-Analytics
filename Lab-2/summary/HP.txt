Harry learns about Hogwarts houses, Quidditch, and the wizarding world from Ron. Hermione Granger, a Muggle-born with an impressive knowledge of magic, joins briefly.
Harry also meets Draco Malfoy, who offers friendship but mocks Ron’s family. Harry refuses, leading to tension between them. After a long journey, they reach Hogwarts, where Hagrid leads the first-year students across a lake with small boats, offering them their first magical view of the castle.

Professor McGonagall leads the first-year students into Hogwarts, where they experience the awe of the Great Hall, enchanted ceiling, and the Sorting Ceremony. Each student tries on the Sorting Hat, which determines their house: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Harry, nervous and hoping to avoid Slytherin, is relieved when the Hat places him in Gryffindor. He joins the Gryffindor table, where he meets other students and enjoys a feast with delicious food and desserts. During the meal, he notices Professor Snape, whose look causes a painful twinge in Harry’s scar, leading Harry to feel disliked.
Afterward, Dumbledore addresses the school with various notices, including the prohibition of entry into the third-floor corridor. A raucous school song concludes the evening. Percy, a Gryffindor prefect, leads the first years to the common room, introducing them to Peeves the poltergeist along the way. Finally, exhausted from the eventful day, Harry falls asleep, dreaming of strange images involving Professor Quirrell’s turban, Slytherin, and Snape.

On Harry’s first day of classes, whispers about him spread throughout the school. Navigating Hogwarts proves challenging, with its moving staircases, trick doors, and poltergeist Peeves causing trouble. Harry and Ron encounter Argus Filch, the unpleasant caretaker, and his equally disliked cat, Mrs. Norris.
Classes begin with Astronomy, Herbology, Charms, and Transfiguration, each introducing them to the complexities of magic. Defense Against the Dark Arts is disappointing, as Professor Quirrell is nervous and unremarkable. Potions, taught by Professor Snape, is intense and unpleasant. Snape singles Harry out with difficult questions, and Harry quickly realizes that Snape dislikes him.
Harry receives an invitation to tea with Hagrid, which he and Ron eagerly accept. Hagrid offers them advice and tells stories, though Harry notices that Hagrid avoids eye contact when discussing Snape and the Gringotts break-in, which happened on Harry’s birthday. Harry suspects that the object Hagrid retrieved from the vault was the target of the break-in, fueling his curiosity about Hogwarts and its secrets.

In their first flying lesson, Harry and the other Gryffindors must face off against the Slytherins, including Draco Malfoy, whom Harry has quickly come to despise. When Malfoy taunts Neville and steals his Remembrall, Harry pursues him on a broom, impressing everyone with his flying skills. Professor McGonagall notices Harry’s natural talent and recruits him to join the Gryffindor Quidditch team as a Seeker, making him the youngest team member in a century.
Later that evening, Malfoy challenges Harry to a “wizard’s duel” at midnight, which he secretly sets up as a trap for Harry. When Harry, Ron, and the reluctant Hermione and Neville arrive at the trophy room, they narrowly escape Filch, the caretaker, and Peeves the poltergeist. While fleeing, they accidentally enter the forbidden third-floor corridor, where they encounter a monstrous three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor.
Back in the common room, Hermione scolds them for their recklessness, but Harry realizes the dog must be guarding the mysterious object Hagrid retrieved from Gringotts.

As Halloween approaches, Harry and Ron continue enjoying their time at Hogwarts, speculating about the mysterious package under the three-headed dog’s protection. Harry also receives a Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick from Professor McGonagall, leading to jealousy from Draco Malfoy and making him even more eager for Quidditch training. During his first session, Harry learns the rules and structure of Quidditch from team captain Oliver Wood, who’s thrilled with Harry’s skill.
On Halloween, the students enjoy the festivities until Professor Quirrell bursts into the Great Hall, announcing that a troll has entered the dungeons. Prefects lead the students back to their dormitories, but Harry and Ron remember that Hermione, who had been avoiding them, doesn’t know about the troll. They rush to warn her and find her trapped in the girls’ bathroom with the troll. Through bravery and quick thinking, they manage to knock out the troll, with Ron using the “Wingardium Leviosa” spell.
Professor McGonagall and other teachers arrive, and Hermione lies to protect Harry and Ron from punishment, saying she went after the troll alone. McGonagall deducts points from Gryffindor for Hermione’s actions but also rewards Harry and Ron for their bravery. From this experience, the three form a strong friendship, realizing that some bonds are unbreakable when facing danger together.

As November arrives, the weather turns cold, and Harry prepares for his first Quidditch match against Slytherin. He’s nervous, but the support from friends like Hermione, who provides a charm to warm them during breaks and helps with homework, keeps him going. Harry and his teammates train intensely, and Wood keeps Harry’s skills a secret, hoping he’ll be a surprise asset for Gryffindor.
During the match, Gryffindor performs well, but Harry’s broom suddenly starts behaving erratically, trying to throw him off. Hermione and Ron realize that Snape is casting a spell on Harry’s broom, so Hermione sets Snape’s robes on fire, which breaks the jinx. With control of his broom restored, Harry spots and catches the Golden Snitch, securing Gryffindor’s victory despite some controversy over his near-swallowing of the Snitch.
After the game, Hagrid is shocked when Harry, Ron, and Hermione confront him about Snape’s intentions. Hagrid insists that Snape would never try to harm a student, especially to steal what “Fluffy” (Hagrid’s three-headed dog) is guarding. During the conversation, Hagrid accidentally mentions “Nicolas Flamel,” sparking further curiosity in the trio about what Snape is truly after.

As Christmas approaches, Hogwarts is transformed by snow, festive decorations, and the students’ excitement. Harry, who stays at school, receives presents for the first time, including a mysterious invisibility cloak that once belonged to his father. Overcome with curiosity, Harry tries the cloak and decides to visit the Restricted Section of the library to find information on Nicolas Flamel. However, his plan is interrupted by a screaming book and a close call with Filch and Snape, prompting him to hide in an unused classroom. There, he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows him his family standing around him.
When Harry returns with Ron, the mirror reveals Ron’s own deepest desire: to be Gryffindor’s head boy and Quidditch captain. But Harry becomes fixated on seeing his family and visits the mirror alone. On his third night, Dumbledore finds him and explains that the Mirror of Erised reveals a person’s most desperate desires, cautioning Harry not to dwell on dreams. When asked, Dumbledore humorously claims he sees himself holding a pair of thick woolen socks. Though unsure if Dumbledore is truthful, Harry begins to understand the mirror’s dangers and its hold over him.

After Dumbledore’s warning, Harry tries to avoid the Mirror of Erised, but he’s still troubled by nightmares. Meanwhile, he and his friends keep searching for information on Nicolas Flamel. Their breakthrough comes when Harry finds Flamel mentioned on a Dumbledore trading card: Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone, a magical artifact that can turn metal into gold and grant immortality. They deduce that the stone is what’s being guarded by the three-headed dog, Fluffy.
As the next Quidditch match approaches, tensions rise because Snape will referee the game. Despite his friends’ concerns, Harry decides to play, hoping to overcome his fears of Snape. To his relief, Dumbledore shows up to watch the match, providing a sense of safety. Harry quickly catches the Snitch, securing Gryffindor’s win, but afterward, he sees Snape sneaking into the Forbidden Forest and follows him. Hidden in a tree, he overhears Snape threatening Professor Quirrell about helping him get past Fluffy and the other enchantments guarding the stone. Harry, Ron, and Hermione realize that the Sorcerer’s Stone is only safe as long as Quirrell resists Snape, leading them to fear that the stone’s protection may not last much longer.

In this chapter, the mystery surrounding the Sorcerer’s Stone continues as the trio notices Quirrell’s deteriorating condition, but they also observe that he hasn’t betrayed its secrets to Snape yet. Hermione is more concerned about exams and her study schedules, but when they see Hagrid suspiciously hiding something, they realize it might be a dragon egg. Hagrid confirms this when they visit him, explaining that he won it in a card game. Over the next week, the baby dragon, a Norwegian Ridgeback named Norbert, hatches, but things quickly get out of hand as Norbert grows larger and more dangerous.
Malfoy finds out about the dragon, which puts Harry, Ron, and Hermione on edge. Eventually, Harry devises a plan to send Norbert to Ron’s brother, Charlie, who works with dragons in Romania. They agree to meet Charlie’s friends in the highest tower at midnight. However, on the night they carry out the plan, they encounter Professor McGonagall catching Malfoy sneaking around to expose them, and she assigns him detention.
Though they successfully hand off Norbert, Harry and Hermione’s joy is short-lived—they realize, too late, that they’ve left the invisibility cloak on the tower. Returning down the stairs, they run into Filch, who is ready to punish them.

Harry, Hermione, Neville, and Malfoy are caught sneaking around by Filch and punished by Professor McGonagall, who deducts 150 points each from Gryffindor, making Harry and his friends outcasts. They’re also assigned a detention in the Forbidden Forest with Hagrid to investigate the mysterious attacks on unicorns. The group splits, and Harry and Malfoy encounter a cloaked figure drinking blood from a dead unicorn. Harry feels intense pain in his scar as the figure moves toward him, but a centaur named Firenze rescues him and explains that drinking unicorn blood can keep someone alive, though it leaves them cursed.
Harry realizes that Voldemort is seeking the Sorcerer’s Stone to regain full strength. Firenze’s fellow centaurs, Ronan and Bane, disapprove of his intervention, suggesting that fate should take its course. Harry returns to Gryffindor Tower, shaken by the knowledge that Voldemort might be nearby. However, he finds comfort in Dumbledore’s presence and strength.
At the end of the night, Harry discovers his invisibility cloak returned to him with a note: “Just in case.”

After completing their exams, Harry, Hermione, and Ron realize that Hagrid may have accidentally revealed how to bypass Fluffy, the three-headed dog guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone. They urgently try to warn Dumbledore, only to find he has left for London. They suspect this absence is a ruse to enable Snape to steal the Stone.
That night, they use Harry’s invisibility cloak to sneak past the obstacles leading to the Stone. Each challenge tests a skill: Hagrid’s lullaby for Fluffy, Professor Sprout’s Devil’s Snare, Professor Flitwick’s enchanted keys, Professor McGonagall’s giant chess game, and Snape’s potion riddle. Ron sacrifices himself in the chess game, allowing Harry and Hermione to advance. Hermione solves the potion riddle, and Harry alone proceeds through the black flames to the final room, expecting to face Snape.
However, Harry is shocked to find not Snape but someone else already waiting there.

Harry faces Professor Quirrell in the final chamber, where Quirrell reveals he has been aiding Voldemort, who lives on the back of Quirrell’s head. Quirrell tries to use the Mirror of Erised to find the Sorcerer’s Stone, but Dumbledore had charmed the mirror so only someone who wanted to find but not use the Stone could retrieve it. Harry sees his reflection hide the Stone in his pocket, and suddenly, he feels the real Stone appear there.
When Voldemort realizes Harry has the Stone, he orders Quirrell to seize him. However, Quirrell finds himself in unbearable pain whenever he touches Harry, due to a magical protection left by Harry’s mother’s love. Harry holds on to Quirrell until he collapses from the pain of his scar and passes out.
Harry awakens in the hospital wing, where Dumbledore explains that he arrived just in time to save him and that the Stone has been destroyed. Dumbledore shares insights on love, courage, and the nature of death and tells Harry that Voldemort will likely attempt to return again someday.
The chapter concludes with Gryffindor winning the House Cup after Dumbledore awards last-minute points to Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville for their bravery. The year ends joyously, and Harry returns to the Muggle world with the knowledge that he has true friends at Hogwarts and that his adventures are just beginning.
